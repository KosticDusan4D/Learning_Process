Dusan Kostic - PHP Internship test

These are some notes I want to include into test.

- Just make on your localhost database and user named as you like, after that in file "connection.php" make changes for your username, password and database. After that run a script just to check if the connection is on.

- I've exported base that I used in the process so that you can see everything easier. Or I included "database.php" which you can run to make table, after that you can fill table on Register page.

- Security: I know that md5 for password is crackable by just copying to google, but I haven't worked yet with password_hash() in PHP, although I learned that it is much safer way.
